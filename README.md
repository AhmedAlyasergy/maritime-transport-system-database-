The objective of this project is to design and implement a comprehensive Maritime Management System that streamlines the operations of ships, passengers, cargo, and dock management. The system aims to efficiently manage ship schedules, passenger payments, cargo tracking, and employee assignments while ensuring accurate data handling and reporting. By integrating features like passenger and cargo allocation, payment processing, and dock status monitoring, the system addresses the logistical challenges of maritime transportation, enhancing operational efficiency and user experience.
We chose a Maritime Management System because it addresses the critical need for efficient organization and tracking in the maritime transportation industry. This system simplifies complex processes such as scheduling ship departures and arrivals, managing passenger bookings, tracking cargo, and assigning employees, which are often prone to errors when handled manually. Maritime transportation plays a vital role in global trade and travel, making it essential to develop a system that enhances operational efficiency, reduces delays, and ensures data accuracy, ultimately supporting better decision-making and improving overall service quality.
